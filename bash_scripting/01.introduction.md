## 1. What is Bash?

Bash, or the Bourne Again SHell, is a command-line interpreter and scripting language widely used in Unix-like operating systems. It is the default shell for many Linux distributions and macOS.

## 2. Why Learn Bash Scripting?

Bash scripting provides a powerful and efficient way to automate tasks and perform system administration. Learning Bash enables you to:
- Write scripts to automate repetitive tasks.
- Customize and enhance your command-line experience.
- Create and run complex commands more efficiently.

## 3. Getting Started

### 3.1 Opening a Bash Shell

To open a Bash shell, use the terminal or command prompt on your operating system.

- On Linux: Use the terminal application.
- On macOS: Launch the Terminal.
- On Windows: Install a terminal emulator like Git Bash or use Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL).

### 3.2 Basic Commands

Start with some basic commands to navigate the filesystem:

```bash
# List files and directories
ls

# Change directory
cd /path/to/directory

# Print the current working directory
pwd

# Create a new directory
mkdir my_directory

# Remove a file
rm file.txt

# Copy a file
cp source_file destination_directory/
```

These commands form the foundation for interacting with the command line.

**Tip:** Use the `--help` option with commands to display their manual pages and learn more about their options and usage.

Now that you have a brief overview, let's dive deeper into Bash scripting concepts and syntax in the upcoming sections.
