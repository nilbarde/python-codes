# Bash Scripting Guide - Control Structures

This section covers control structures in Bash scripting, including conditional statements and loops. Control structures enable you to make decisions and repeat actions based on conditions.

## 1. Conditional Statements

Conditional statements allow you to execute different blocks of code based on specified conditions.

### 1.1 `if` Statement

The `if` statement is used for basic conditional branching.

```bash
if [ condition ]; then
    # Code to execute if condition is true
fi
```

### 1.2 `elif` Statement

The `elif` statement is used for additional conditions in the same block.

```bash
if [ condition1 ]; then
    # Code to execute if condition1 is true
elif [ condition2 ]; then
    # Code to execute if condition2 is true
else
    # Code to execute if none of the conditions are true
fi
```

### 1.3 Comparison Operators

Use various comparison operators in conditional statements:

- `-eq`: Equal
- `-ne`: Not equal
- `-lt`: Less than
- `-le`: Less than or equal
- `-gt`: Greater than
- `-ge`: Greater than or equal

Example:

```bash
if [ $num -gt 10 ]; then
    echo "Number is greater than 10"
fi
```

## 2. Loops

Loops enable you to repeatedly execute a block of code.

### 2.1 `for` Loop

The `for` loop iterates over a sequence.

```bash
for variable in sequence; do
    # Code to execute for each iteration
done
```

Example:

```bash
for i in {1..5}; do
    echo "Iteration $i"
done
```

### 2.2 `while` Loop

The `while` loop executes code as long as a condition is true.

```bash
while [ condition ]; do
    # Code to execute while the condition is true
done
```

Example:

```bash
count=0
while [ $count -lt 5 ]; do
    echo "Count: $count"
    ((count++))
done
```

### 2.3 `until` Loop

The `until` loop executes code until a condition becomes true.

```bash
until [ condition ]; do
    # Code to execute until the condition becomes true
done
```

Example:

```bash
num=0
until [ $num -eq 5 ]; do
    echo "Number is $num"
    ((num++))
done
```
