## 1. Basic Script Structure

In this example, we'll create a simple Bash script to understand the basic structure and execution of scripts.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Your script code here
echo "Hello, World!"
```

## 2. File and Directory Manipulation

Explore how to manipulate files and directories using Bash scripting.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Your script code here
mkdir my_directory
cd my_directory
touch new_file.txt
```

## 3. Working with Arrays

Learn how to use arrays in Bash scripts.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Your script code here
fruits=("Apple" "Banana" "Orange")
for fruit in "${fruits[@]}"; do
  echo "I like $fruit"
done
```

## 4. Advanced Control Structures

See examples of advanced control structures, including nested loops and conditionals.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Your script code here
for ((i=1; i<=5; i++)); do
  for ((j=1; j<=i; j++)); do
    echo -n "* "
  done
  echo
done
```

## 5. Input Validation and Error Handling

Learn how to validate user input and handle errors gracefully.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Your script code here
read -p "Enter a number: " num
if ! [[ "$num" =~ ^[0-9]+$ ]]; then
  echo "Error: Not a valid number."
  exit 1
fi
echo "You entered: $num"
```

## 6. Creating a Simple Menu

Build a simple menu system for user interaction.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Your script code here
echo "Choose an option:"
select option in "Option 1" "Option 2" "Option 3"; do
  case $option in
    "Option 1") echo "You selected Option 1"; break;;
    "Option 2") echo "You selected Option 2"; break;;
    "Option 3") echo "You selected Option 3"; break;;
    *) echo "Invalid option";;
  esac
done
```

## 7. Text Processing with awk

Explore text processing using the `awk` command in Bash scripts.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Your script code here
echo "John Doe,25" | awk -F ',' '{print "Name: " $1, "Age: " $2}'
```

## 8. Recursive File Operations

Learn how to perform recursive file operations, such as searching for files in nested directories.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Your script code here
find . -type f -name "*.txt" -exec echo "Found file: {}" \;
```

## 9. Background Processes and Job Control

Understand how to work with background processes and job control in Bash.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Your script code here
./background_process.sh &
echo "Script continues while background process runs."
```

## 10. Interactive Scripting

Create an interactive script that takes user input and provides real-time feedback.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Your script code here
read -p "Enter your name: " name
echo "Hello, $name! Welcome to the interactive script."
```

These examples cover various aspects of Bash scripting, from basic structures to more advanced concepts. Use them as templates and modify them according to your specific scripting needs.
