## 1 Creating a Bash Script

### 1.1 Text Editors for Scripting

Before creating a Bash script, choose a text editor for scripting. Common choices include `nano`, `vim`, or any text editor of your preference.

For example, using `nano`:

```bash
nano myscript.sh
```

### 1.2 Creating and Saving Your First Script

Inside the text editor, add the following lines to create a simple script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

echo "Hello, Bash Scripting!"
```

- The first line (`#!/bin/bash`) is called a shebang and indicates the path to the Bash interpreter.
- The second line (`echo "Hello, Bash Scripting!"`) prints a message to the console.

Save the file and exit the text editor.

## 2 Running a Bash Script

### 2.1 Creating Executable

Make the script executable using the `chmod` command:

```bash
chmod +x myscript.sh
```

### 2.2 Running Scripts

```bash
$ ./myscript.sh
Hello, Bash Scripting!
```
If you want to run a script without making it executable, use the `bash` command:

```bash
bash myscript.sh
```

This allows you to run the script without changing its permission.
