## 1. Reading User Input

In Bash scripting, reading user input is a common task, especially for interactive scripts. The `read` command is used for this purpose.

### 1.1 Basic `read` Command

The basic syntax of the `read` command is as follows:

```bash
read -p "Enter your name: " username
echo "Hello, $username!"
```

- `-p`: Specifies a prompt to display.
- `username`: Variable to store the user input.

### 1.2 Input Validation

Performing basic input validation to ensure the entered data meets specific criteria:

```bash
read -p "Enter your age: " age

if [[ "$age" =~ ^[0-9]+$ ]]; then
  echo "You entered a valid age: $age"
else
  echo "Invalid input. Please enter a numeric value."
fi
```

## 2. Output to Screen and Files

Bash provides various commands to display output on the screen and redirect it to files.

### 2.1 `echo` Command

The `echo` command is used to print text to the screen:

```bash
echo "Hello, World!"
```

### 2.2 Formatting with `printf`

The `printf` command allows for more advanced formatting:

```bash
name="John"
age=25
printf "Name: %s\nAge: %d\n" "$name" "$age"
```

### 2.3 Redirecting Output

Redirecting output to files using `>` (overwrite) and `>>` (append):

```bash
echo "This is a line of text" > output.txt
echo "This is another line" >> output.txt
```

### 2.4 Reading from Files

Reading and displaying the contents of a file:

```bash
file_contents=$(<filename.txt)
echo "$file_contents"
```

### 2.5 Piping Output

Piping output from one command to another:

```bash
ls -l | grep ".txt"
```
