## 1. Regular Expressions

### 1.1 Overview
- Introduction to regular expressions in Bash scripting.

### 1.2 Using `grep`
- Basic usage of `grep` for pattern matching.
- Searching for patterns in files.

  ```bash
  # Example: Searching for lines containing "error" in a log file
  grep "error" logfile.txt
  ```

### 1.3 `sed` (Stream Editor)
- Transforming and editing text using `sed`.
- Replacing, deleting, and inserting text.

  ```bash
  # Example: Replacing "apple" with "orange" in a file
  sed 's/apple/orange/g' input.txt
  ```

### 1.4 `awk` Programming
- Overview of `awk` for advanced text processing.
- Writing `awk` scripts for data manipulation.

  ```bash
  # Example: Summing values in the second column of a CSV file
  awk -F',' '{ sum += $2 } END { print sum }' data.csv
  ```

## 2. Process Management

### 2.1 Background Processes
- Running commands in the background.
- Managing background processes.

  ```bash
  # Example: Running a command in the background
  long_running_command &
  ```

### 2.2 Signals
- Introduction to signals in Bash.
- Sending and handling signals in scripts.

  ```bash
  # Example: Handling the SIGTERM signal
  trap 'echo "Received SIGTERM"; cleanup_function' TERM
  ```

### 2.3 Job Control
- Controlling and monitoring jobs in Bash.
- Using `bg`, `fg`, and `jobs` commands.

  ```bash
  # Example: Running a command in the background and bringing it to the foreground
  command &
  fg
  ```

## 3. Error Handling

### 3.1 Exit Codes
- Understanding exit codes in Bash.
- Handling success and failure conditions.

  ```bash
  # Example: Checking the exit code of the last command
  if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
    echo "Command succeeded"
  else
    echo "Command failed"
  fi
  ```

### 3.2 Trapping Signals
- Intercepting and handling signals.
- Graceful termination of scripts.

  ```bash
  # Example: Gracefully handling SIGINT (Ctrl+C)
  trap 'echo "Received SIGINT"; cleanup_function' INT
  ```

## 4. Debugging

### 4.1 `set -x` and `set +x`
- Enabling and disabling debugging output.
- Tracing script execution.

  ```bash
  # Example: Using set -x for debugging
  set -x
  # Your script commands here
  set +x
  ```

### 4.2 `PS4` Environment Variable
- Customizing the prompt for debugging.
- Adding context to debug output.

  ```bash
  # Example: Customizing the PS4 prompt
  PS4='Executing: '
  ```
